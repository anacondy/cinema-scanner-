🌑 CINEMATIC ARCHIVES // AI Artifact Analyzer"Every living creature on this earth dies alone." — Donnie DarkoCinematic Archives is an immersive, high-performance React application designed to analyze movie posters, game covers, and portraits using Google's Gemini AI.Built with a focus on atmosphere, it features a custom physics particle engine, 60fps+ animations, and a "Deep Search" mode that bypasses standard safety filters to analyze obscure or complex media.✨ Key Features👁️ Visual & ImmersiveDynamic Particle System: A custom Canvas-based engine that generates "Time Dust" particles. It utilizes requestAnimationFrame to automatically sync with high-refresh-rate displays (90Hz, 120Hz, 144Hz) for buttery smooth motion.Aesthetic Adaptation: The UI shifts color palettes (Emerald/Purple/Amber) based on the scanning phase.Atmospheric UI: Grain overlays, glassmorphism, and custom scrollbars to match the Donnie Darko / Sci-Fi Thriller aesthetic.🧠 AI Intelligence (Gemini Integration)Multi-Modal Analysis: Identifies Movies, Games, and People (Celebrities/Actors).Deep Network Scan: Integrated Google Search Grounding to verify obscure details.Unrestricted Mode: Safety settings configured to BLOCK_NONE to prevent false positives on artistic or mature poster art.Smart Fallback: Custom error states ("Security Clearance Failed") that maintain immersion even when APIs fail.⚡ Performance & CompatibilityAspect Ratio Fluidity: Optimized for standard 16:9 and ultra-wide 20:9 mobile displays.Drag & Drop: Supports batch uploading of multiple artifacts.Responsive Layout: Flex/Grid architecture ensures no layout breakage across devices.🛠️ Installation & SetupTo run this project locally, you need Node.js installed.Clone the repositorygit clone [https://github.com/your-username/cinematic-archives.git](https://github.com/your-username/cinematic-archives.git)

📦 DependenciesThis project relies on the following core libraries:React (v18+): Core UI framework.Lucide-React: For the vector icon set (Scan, Zap, Globe, etc.).Tailwind CSS: For utility-first styling and responsive design.Framer Motion (Optional): If you decide to add complex transitions later (current build uses native CSS animations for performance).🚀 Deployment (GitHub Pages)This project is configured for deployment via gh-pages.Update vite.config.js with your repo name as the base:base: '/cinematic-archives/',
Run the build script:npm run deploy
📱 Mobile & Display OptimizationHigh Refresh Rate: The particle loop uses delta time calculation implicitly via browser refresh syncing.20:9 Support: The main container uses min-h-screen and pb-24 to account for mobile browser UI bars and notches.Touch Targets: All buttons have a minimum tap area of 44px for accessibility.⚠️ DisclaimerThis interface uses Google's Generative AI. Responses are generated by a machine and may occasionally be inaccurate. The "Unrestricted Mode" is enabled for artistic analysis purposes; user discretion is advised.
